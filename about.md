Free speech is the free expression of thoughts, and throughout history, many rulers feel challenged by such ideas.
Every time we thought we find a platform for free expression, someone would try to censor it one way or the other.
The internet was the closest we have gotten to an uncensorable platform, a place where men and women can discover and exchange ideas freely.
However, in the past years, we learned that this has changed.
In some countries, our thoughts are being policed by the state.
In others where state actors seem to be less involved in censorship, our thoughts are moderated by cultural activists and the force of capitalism.
Blogging remains one of the few ways where individuals can share their ideas without having to submit to the politics of the publishers, but even that is threatened by political stands of the platform or payment processor.
Ghost - with subscription in crypto
We deserve a platform where not only content creators can host their content, but one where they can depend on for sustainable revenue without worrying about having to oblige to a predefined set of political stands.
That's why we built Etherem Ghost, a self-hostable subscription server integrated with Ghost. Content creators can integrate their Ghost blog with Ethereum Ghost using our custom theme (we are starting just with a Casper-fork) to receive subscription payment in crypto.
